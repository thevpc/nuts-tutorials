`simple-project` gives an example of developing an application that does not use any maven plugin. 

It wont be executable unless you configure correctly your classpath and main class in the a long long java commandline. 

Still it is fully supported by `nuts` (without any `nuts` dependency of course). Please not also that no `META-INF.MF` has been configured either. 

As you can see, really there are NO EXPECTATIONS for `nuts` to work properly!!!
